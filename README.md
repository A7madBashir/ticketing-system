# **AI-Powered Ticketing System**

## **Overview**
The **AI-Powered Ticketing System** is a robust, multi-tenant SaaS platform designed to streamline customer support and ticket management for businesses. It leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to automate responses, escalate unresolved issues, and improve operational efficiency. Built using **ASP.NET Core 9**, this system is highly scalable, modular, and optimized for performance in cloud environments.

This system is ideal for businesses that need:
- A centralized platform for managing customer queries and support tickets.
- AI-driven chatbot functionality to handle repetitive queries and reduce agent workload.
- Scalable architecture to accommodate multiple tenants (agencies) in a SaaS environment.
- Advanced analytics to monitor performance and optimize workflows.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Multi-Tenant Support**
- Each agency (tenant) operates independently within the system.
- Data isolation ensures that one agency's data does not interfere with another's.
- Agencies can manage their own users, FAQs, subscriptions, and integrations.

### **2. AI Chatbot Integration**
- **FAQ-Based Responses**: The chatbot retrieves answers from predefined FAQs to resolve common queries.
- **Escalation to Tickets**: If the chatbot cannot resolve a query, it escalates the issue to a human agent by creating a ticket.
- **Customizable Knowledge Base**: Agencies can add, edit, or delete FAQs to improve the chatbot’s accuracy.

### **3. Ticket Management**
- **Ticket Lifecycle**: Customers can create tickets manually or via chatbot escalation. Agents can assign, reply to, and resolve tickets.
- **Prioritization**: Tickets can be categorized by priority (e.g., low, medium, high, urgent) to ensure critical issues are addressed first.
- **Status Tracking**: Customers and agents can track the status of tickets in real-time.

### **4. User Roles and Permissions**
- **Customer**: Submits queries, creates tickets, and tracks ticket status.
- **Agent**: Assigns tickets, replies to customers, resolves issues, and monitors performance metrics.
- **Admin**: Manages FAQs, subscriptions, integrations, user roles, and system-wide analytics.

### **5. Analytics and Reporting**
- **Performance Metrics**: Track key metrics such as tickets resolved per hour, average response time, and customer satisfaction scores.
- **Custom Reports**: Generate reports on ticket resolution times, agent performance, and overall system health.

### **6. Subscription Plans**
- Agencies can choose from different subscription plans (e.g., Basic, Pro, Enterprise) based on their needs.
- Plans include features like advanced analytics, priority support, and additional integrations.

### **7. Third-Party Integrations**
- Seamlessly integrate with tools like CRM, ERP, and payment gateways.
- Enable/disable integrations as needed through the admin dashboard.

### **8. FAQ Management**
- Agencies can maintain a public knowledge base of FAQs for self-service support.
- FAQs are used by the chatbot to respond to customer queries.

### **9. Real-Time Communication**
- Customers and agents can communicate through replies on tickets.
- Internal notes allow agents to collaborate privately without exposing sensitive information to customers.

### **10. Security and Compliance**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users only access data relevant to their role.
- Data encryption and secure authentication protect sensitive information.

## **How It Works**

### **1. Customer Workflow**
1. **Submit Query**: The customer submits a query via the chatbot interface.
2. **Receive Response**: The chatbot responds using FAQs or escalates the issue to a ticket if unresolved.
3. **Create Ticket**: The customer can also create tickets manually if preferred.
4. **Track Status**: The customer tracks the status of their tickets until resolution.

### **2. Agent Workflow**
1. **Assign Tickets**: Agents view unassigned tickets and assign them to themselves or other agents.
2. **Reply to Tickets**: Agents reply to tickets, either resolving the issue or requesting more information.
3. **Resolve Tickets**: Once resolved, agents mark the ticket as closed and notify the customer.
4. **Monitor Performance**: Agents can view their performance metrics to identify areas for improvement.

### **3. Admin Workflow**
1. **Manage FAQs**: Admins add, edit, or delete FAQs to improve the chatbot’s knowledge base.
2. **Generate Reports**: Admins generate analytics reports to monitor system performance and agent productivity.
3. **Configure Integrations**: Admins set up and manage third-party integrations.
4. **Manage Subscriptions**: Admins handle subscription plans, billing, and feature upgrades for the agency.
